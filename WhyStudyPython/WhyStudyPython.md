**Python is becoming increasingly popular**

When Python was first created, it was not very powerful.
Its performance was low, it did not support multiple cores, and it had no real concurrency.
Back then, computing power was not very strong, so Python never became popular.
Many people didn’t even know this language existed.

With time, hardware performance improved, and the complexity of software also increased.
Development efficiency became more important to companies.
So, a different mindset appeared:

In early software development, performance is not as important as development efficiency.
There is no need to save less than 1 millisecond of time while increasing development workload by several times — that is not worth it.

Thus, development efficiency became more important than machine performance,
and Python gradually gained more and more attention from developers.

Between 2012 and 2014, cloud computing started booming.
Many startups and Internet giants entered the cloud computing field.
The most well-known open-source cloud computing platform, OpenStack, is developed based on Python.

In the following years, the most talked-about fields — Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) — chose Python as their primary development language.

So far, Python has become the focus of Internet development.
According to the latest TIOBE Index (2024–2025), Python has now reached the #1 position worldwide, showing continuous growth in popularity.

**Python developers earn high salaries**

Python developers are among the highest-paid developers, especially in data science, machine learning, and web development.

In major Indian tech cities such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, and Gurugram, Python developer salaries easily reach ₹1.5L+ per month (₹18L+ per year).

| City (India) | Artificial Intelligence | Big Data / Data Engineering | Python Development | Average Salary |
|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Bengaluru    | ₹30,00,000 / year       | ₹22,50,000 / year            | ₹18,00,000 / year   | ₹23,50,000 / year |
| Hyderabad    | ₹26,00,000 / year       | ₹20,00,000 / year            | ₹16,00,000 / year   | ₹20,50,000 / year |
| Pune         | ₹22,00,000 / year       | ₹18,00,000 / year            | ₹13,00,000 / year   | ₹17,50,000 / year |
| Gurugram     | ₹21,00,000 / year       | ₹17,00,000 / year            | ₹12,00,000 / year   | ₹17,00,000 / year |

**Python is easy to learn and very powerful**

If you are a beginner, learning Python is your best choice, because it is easy to learn, powerful, and you can easily build web applications with it. It is very suitable as a beginner’s first programming language.

In India, Python is widely taught in colleges, engineering courses, and even in school. Many schools have already introduced Python as the first programming language.

**If you already have some programming experience, learning Python is also a good choice**, because Python is very likely to be the mainstream development direction in the future. Learning one more language gives you one more useful skill. Moreover, Python has powerful libraries and frameworks, which allow tools and applications to be developed very quickly, helping and improving your main development work.
