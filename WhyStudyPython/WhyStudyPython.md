Python is becoming increasingly popular

When Python was first created, it was not very powerful.
Its performance was low, it did not support multiple cores, and it had no real concurrency.
Back then, computing power was not very strong, so Python never became popular.
Many people didn’t even know this language existed.

With time, hardware performance improved, and the complexity of software also increased.
Development efficiency became more important to companies.
So, a different mindset appeared:

In early software development, performance is not as important as development efficiency.
There is no need to save less than 1 millisecond of time while increasing development workload by several times — that is not worth it.

Thus, development efficiency became more important than machine performance,
and Python gradually gained more and more attention from developers.

Between 2012 and 2014, cloud computing started booming.
Many startups and Internet giants entered the cloud computing field.
The most well-known open-source cloud computing platform, OpenStack, is developed based on Python.

In the following years, the most talked-about fields — Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) — chose Python as their primary development language.

So far, Python has become the focus of Internet development.
In earlier “Top 10 Programming Languages Trend Chart” data, Python had jumped to third place in 2017 and became the most popular language that year.
According to the latest TIOBE Index (2024–2025), Python has now reached the #1 position worldwide, showing continuous growth in popularity.
