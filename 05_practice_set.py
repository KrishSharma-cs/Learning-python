'''
so today i just practiced what i learned till now.
this small example uses print() and multi-line strings together.
'''

print('''Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh! ''')

'''
notes:
triple quotes are used for multi-line strings. 
they let you print text in multiple lines easily.
great for poems, lyrics, or simple formatting.
