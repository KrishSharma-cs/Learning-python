'''
today i learned how to take input from the user
and show it back using print().
this is how python starts a real conversation with you ðŸ˜„
'''

# taking input from the user
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# showing the data back
print("Hello", name)
print("You are", age, "years old.")

# as you can see, when we print it, python shows whatever is stored in the variable.

'''
notes:
input() is used to take data from the user.
by default, input() returns a string.
print() is used to show messages or values on the screen.
'''

# example: combining both
print("Nice to meet you,", name + "!")

'''
this was fun now python doesnâ€™t just talk,
it listens too
